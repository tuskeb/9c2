Their hits include covers of Bruce Springsteen's "For You", "Blinded by the Light" and "Spirit in the Night".

                <p>Madman drummer bummers<br>
                    Indians in the summer<br>
                    With a teenage diplomat<br>
                    In the dumps with the mumps<br>
                    As the adolescent pumps<br>
                    His way into his hat<br>
                    With a boulder on my shoulder<br>
                    Feeling kinda older<br>
                    I tripped a merry-go-round<br>
                    With this very unpleasing<br>
                    Sneezing and wheezing<br>
                    The calliope crashed to the ground<br>
                    The calliope crashed to the ground</p>

                <p>But she was blinded by the light<br>
                    Revved up like a deuce<br>
                    Another runner in the night<br>

                    Another runner in the night</p>

                <p>Some silicone sister<br>
                    With her manager mister<br>
                    Told me I got what it takes<br>
                    She said, I'll turn you on sonny to something strong<br>
                    Play the song with the funky break<br>
                    And go-kart Mozart<br>
                    Was checking out the weather chart<br>
                    To see if it was safe outside<br>
                    And little Early Pearly<br>
                    Came by in his curly-wurly<br>
                    And asked me if I needed a ride<br>
                    Asked me if I needed a ride</p>

                <p>'Cause she was blinded by the light<br>
                    Revved up like a deuce<br>
                    Another runner in the night<br>
                    Blinded by the light</p>

                <p>She got down but she never got tight<br>
                    She's gonna make it to the night<br>
                    She's gonna make it through the night</p>

                <p>But mama, that's where the fun is<br>
                    But mama, that's where the fun is</p>

                <p>Mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun<br>
                    But mama, that's where the fun is</p>

                <p>Some brimstone baritone<br>
                    Anticyclone rolling stone<br>
                    Preacher from the east<br>
                    Says, "Dethrone the Dictaphone<br>
                    Hit it in its funny bone<br>
                    That's where they expect it least."<br>
                    And some new mown chaperone<br>
                    Was standing in the corner<br>
                    Watching the young girls dance<br>
                    And some fresh-sown moonstone<br>
                    Was messing with his frozen zone<br>
                    Reminding him of romance</p>

                <p>The calliope crashed to the ground</p>

                <p>But she was blinded by the light<br>
